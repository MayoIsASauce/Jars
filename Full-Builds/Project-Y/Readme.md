# Data Generator
### Created by Matt August

I created this generator a while ago to test my skills in building and storing data in python. I recently repurposed it to generated student data for sql databases.

## Features

- **generate <int>** up to 3,996 students at once to Students.csv.
- **list** all students inside the Students.csv.
- **make** a specific student to specifications.
- Precise data retrieval.
- Entirely open-sourced.

### Commands can be issued such as
```python
sophmore year -> retrieve the graduating year of sophmores.
freshman first -> retrieve the first names of all freshman
```
and many more similar commands.
